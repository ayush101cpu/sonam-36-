<div id="birds"><p>Birds are a diverse group of warm-blooded vertebrates, characterized by feathers, wings, and the ability to lay hard-shelled eggs. They are found all over the world, inhabiting virtually every type of environment. While many birds are known for their ability to fly, some, like penguins and ostriches, are flightless. Birds play vital roles in ecosystems, from seed dispersal to controlling insect populations, and their beautiful songs and vibrant plumage add to the world's natural beauty. </p></div>
